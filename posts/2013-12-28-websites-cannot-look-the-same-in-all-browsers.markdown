Please understand. Websites don't have to look the same in all browsers.

A big problem in Web development community is that many experienced developers, designers and web-masters don’t understand that each browser renders things differently. So they should not waste time to get "pixel perfection" in everything. If you want everything exactly as the design, 100% pixel perfect, use images for everything over HTML/CSS.

Website -do not- have to look identical in all browsers. But site -does- need to be functional (and hopefully aesthetically pleasing) in all browsers.
<blockquote>"Pixel perfection" in Web is a useless buzz-word created by people who want to control something they don’t understand.</blockquote>
<strong>I have collected a few good articles (see below)</strong> which show and explain differences in rendering of different browsers. Though, I haven’t included mobile browsers comparison example in it. And this post is only about rendering differences not behavior.

Not agree?
