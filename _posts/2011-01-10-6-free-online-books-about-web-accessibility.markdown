<blockquote>Some of the advice in the book is now outdated for developers in the 21st century. Most importantly, the use of tables for layout can almost never be justified anymore. When I wrote the book, it was just barely possible to defend tables for layout (if you used exactly one table) because browser support for CSS was so poor. That isn’t the case anymore and you shouldn’t follow the book when it advises the use of layout tables.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This book answers two questions. The first question is "Why should I make my web site more accessible?" If you do not have a web site, this book is not for you.

<blockquote>To achieve universal usability, Shneiderman identifies three challenges for designers: “to support a wide range of technologies, to accommodate diverse users, and to help users bridge the gap between what they know and what they need to know.” In order to apply these general challenges specifically to Web design, we need to consider the layers of Web site design: function, interface, and content.</blockquote>
